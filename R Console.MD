## Activity overview

<hr>

In the last activity, you downloaded and installed R. You can use the R environment and programming language to conduct data analysis and create visualizations. In this activity, you'll review the basics of working with the R Console and learn how to write and execute a basic command.

This will enable you to better understand the standard R interface. While you will use RStudio for most of the activities, it is useful to know the basics of a programming interface as this will likely come up in your day-to-day work as a data analyst.

## What is the R Console?

<hr>

The **R Console** is the program window in R where you make use of the R programming language. It is an interface that lets you view, write, edit, and execute your R code.

Programs like **RStudio**, an interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in R, use the R Console and other tools to make it easier to write and execute R code. In RStudio, the R Console is often referred to as the **console pane**. It lets you perform any tasks you'd do in the R Console.

However, as you start coding in R, it's helpful to begin with the simplicity of just the R Console. During this hand-on activity, you'll use the R Console to perform simple mathematical operations.

## Use the R console

<hr>

1. Open the R program to use the R Console on your computer. You will find that the console populates a default message. The message starts with R version and your version number, and ends with Type 'q()' to quit R. Above the message, you will find a menu with icons that represent the functions of the console and graphical user interface (known in the program as **RGui**).

2. Click in the blank space to the right of the **>** symbol at the bottom of the console.

This is the prompt, and anything you type after it will be read as executable R code when you press **Enter** (Windows) or **Return** (Mac). Keep in mind that everything you write in the R Console disappears after you end your session (or close the console). If you want to save the code you execute, it is better to save it in a text file or an .rmd file.

3. Type **citation()** after the prompt and press **Enter** (Windows) or **Return** (Mac). This returns instructions for how to cite R in a publication. You don't need to worry about this now, but it will be helpful if you ever use R in a research paper or article.

After you execute the line, the **>** prompt will generate again and you will be able to write a new line of R code. Now, write a mathematical operation. Start with simple addition by using the plus operator (+).

4. Type **4**, then a **+**, then the number **5**. The text you type should look like: 4+5. Press Enter. The R Console will return the answer to this question, which is **9**.

5. On a new line, type **5-4** to use the substraction operator (-). Press **Enter** to execute the code and return the answer, which is 1.

6. On a new line, use the multiplication operator (*) to multiply two numbers. Type **10\*2** and then press **Enter**. This will execute the code and return the answer, which is 20.

7. On a new line, use the **division (/) operator** to divide two numbers. Type **10/2** and then press **Enter**. This will execute the code and return the answer, which is 5.

Your R code and results should look like this:

Congratulations, you've written code in R! You can use R to complete mathematical operators, among many other useful data analysis tasks. This is just the beginning of your journey with writing in R.
