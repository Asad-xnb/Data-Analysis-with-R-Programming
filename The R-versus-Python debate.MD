# The R-versus-Python debate

People often wonder which programming language they should learn first. You might be wondering about this, too. 
R is a great starting point for foundational data analysis, and it has helpful packages that beginners can apply to projects. 

Any Language a beginner starts to learn will have some advantages and challenges. Let's put this into context by looking at R and Python. The following table is a high-level overview based on sampling of articles and opinions of those in the field. You can review the information without necessarily picking a side in the R vs. Python debate.

| Languages|R | Python |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| common features| - Open-source<br>- Data stored in data frames<br>- Formulas and functions readily available<br>- Community for code development and support | - Open-source<br>- Data stored in data frames<br>- Formulas and functions readily available<br>- Community for code development and support |
| Unique advantages | - Data manipulation, data visualization, and statistics packages <br> - "Scalpel" approach to data: find packages to do what you want with the data | - Easy syntax for machine learning needs <br> - Integrates with cloud platforms like Google  Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Azure |
| Unique challenges | - Inconsistent naming conventions make it harder for beginners to select the right functions <br> - Methods for handling variables may be a little complex for beginners to understand | - Many more decisions for beginners to make about data input/output, structure, variables, packages, and objects <br> - "Swiss army knife" approach to data: figure out a way to do what you want with the data |

## Key takeaways

Certain aspects make some programming languages easier to learn than others. But, that doesn’t make the harder languages impossible for beginners to learn. On the flip side, a programming language’s popularity doesn’t always make it the best language for beginners either.   
R has been used by professionals who have a statistical or research-oriented approach to solving problems; among them are scientists, statisticians, and engineers. Python has been used by professionals looking for solutions in the data itself, those who must heavily mine data for answers; among them are data scientists, machine learning specialists, and software developers.
